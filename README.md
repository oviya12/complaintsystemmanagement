This project aims to develop a secure police complaint registration system using advanced encryption techniques and biometric verification.
The system utilizes the Twofish algorithm for encryption to ensure the confidentiality of complaint data. 
Additionally, users are verified through selfie capturing with face detection technology to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of user identities. 
The project is built using Spring framework for backend development, H2 database for data storage, and HTML/CSS for the user interface.

Features:

Twofish Algorithm:
Implements Twofish encryption for securing complaint data during transmission and storage, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

Biometric Verification: Utilizes biometric authentication techniques, including face detection during selfie capturing, to verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access.

Secure Storage: Stores encrypted complaint data and user selfies in an H2 database, providing a secure and reliable storage solution.

User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive web interface developed using Spring, HTML, and CSS, ensuring ease of use and accessibility for all users.

Real-Time Updates: Provides real-time status updates on complaint registration and resolution processes, keeping users informed throughout the complaint lifecycle.

Robust Authentication: Implements strong authentication mechanisms to authenticate users securely and protect against unauthorized access to the system.

Technologies Used:
 
  Spring Framework: Utilizes Spring for building the backend application logic and handling HTTP requests.
  
  H2 Database: Integrates H2 database for storing encrypted complaint data and user information securely.
 
  HTML & CSS: Develops a responsive and visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS, ensuring optimal user experience across devices.
